This project involves using SQL to perform user analysis on the Instagram platform with the goal of deriving business insights for the marketing, product, and development teams. Data is extracted from the ig_clone database, including tables such as comments, follows, likes, photo_tags, photos, tags, and users, and analyzed through SQL queries to answer specific questions from the management team. The insights gained can help in launching new marketing campaigns, tracking the success of the app, deciding on features to build for the app, and improving the user experience.

The tech-stack used for this project is MySQL workbench version 8.0, a popular and powerful relational database management system.
